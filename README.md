We want to propose an efficient way to combat hate crimes in America. Recent stories from the media such as Asian hate crimes in San Francisco and attacks against innocent black victims indicate that America has been failing to protect its diverse people for too long. Observing how hate crime rates fluctuate in relation to the enforcement or lack thereof of certain actions to address hate crimes can help us to gain a better sense of how we can lower hate crime rates today. For example, we can compare statistics from years with low hate crime rates against those with high hate crime rates. Noticing that a particular year had low hate crime rates may direct us toward seeking information regarding initiatives passed by the federal government during that year that may have contributed to that decline. For various years, we can also compare hate crime data such as the biases that inspired a hate crime (e.g. racial bias or gender bias), the hate crimes’ locations, and the victims’ demographics. Thereby, we could propose which groups and locations should be prioritized with services to protect them from possible hate crimes as well as highlight organizations that aid groups most at risk for hate crimes. Our data could even help people move to a certain area where they would be safer if they realize that people of their demographic are prone to attacks where they live. We hope to assist both the government and the people.
